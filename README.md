# Clone of UNTAPPD application 

Created a clone of the popular application UNTAPPD using `PHP` as a backend server with `REACT` as a frontend framework to simplify page reloads and database updates in real time.

Technologies used `JavaScript`, `HTML`, `CSS`, `Node.JS`, `REACT`, `PHP`

### Plans to add an administrative application to manage the backend database manipulations as a Super User.

Will use `Angular` and `Material Design`
